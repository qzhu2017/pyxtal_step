This is an initial library of BibTex references for the pyxtal_step plug-in for SEAMM,
generated automatically by the cookiecutter. You may wish to edit the first entry to correct some
of the information.

Add other references to the end of the file and add code in the plug-in to cite the references as
appropriate. This is done with code like this:

        self.references.cite(
            raw=self._bibliography['doi:10.1002/jcc.21224'],
            alias='packmol',
            module='packmol_step',
            level=1,
            note='The principle PACKMOL citation.'
        )

which is typically in the run() method of the plug-in.

The base node class in SEAMM automatically reads this list of references into a dictionary in
self._bibliography with the key being the key of the BibTex entry -- usually the name on the
first line of the entry after the 'article' or 'misc' (for software) keyword.

See the documentation for the Reference Handler for the other arguments to cite().

# This is the citation for this plug-in, generated and used automatically.
# You might need to edit the author, address, etc. The month, year and version fields
# are automatically filled in with information about current version of the plug-in.
# This is handled in seamm/nody.py, the run() method.
